This project aims at replacing the plugin-web-modules with a more reliable and faster way to create micro-bundles.

A big thank you to Rich Harris for the amazing [Rollup.js](https://rollupjs.org), Guy Bedford for [cjs-module-lexer](https://github.com/guybedford/cjs-module-lexer)
and [es-module-lexer](https://github.com/guybedford/ed-module-lexer) without which this PoC couldn't be possible 
and Fred K. Schott because [Snowpack](https://www.snowpack.dev/) has been a great source of inspiration.
